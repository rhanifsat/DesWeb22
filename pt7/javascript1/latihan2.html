    <h1 id="judul">PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>

    <p>The <mark class="tanda">Faculty of Teacher Training and Education</mark>, <mark class="tanda">Sebelas Maret University</mark>, Surakarta is an <mark class="tanda">Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</mark> which has 24 study programs in 6 majors. Each study program has its own characteristics in producing <mark class="tanda">superior, strong and intelligent educational staff</mark>.
    </p>

    <p>The <mark class="tanda">Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</mark> study program is planned to take shelter in the management of the <mark class="tanda">Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)</mark> department. This placement revises our previous statement, where the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program that will produce graduates who are <mark class="tanda">prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs</mark>. So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as <mark class="tanda">Building Engineering Education</mark>, and <mark class="tanda">Mechanical Engineering Education</mark>. To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct <mark class="tanda">resource sharing with the mathematics study program</mark>.
